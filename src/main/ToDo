General ideas:
for servers/computers create a packet queue that can be enabled through an environment variable
when enabled incoming packets would be placed into the queue instead of being immediately presented to the program, essentially revpack and similar programs may not work.
Instead other program would need to be used to check if there are any packets in the queue and get packets from the queue if so

On in game computers make some sort of google drive like service for "cloud" storage of user created scripts and programs
This would effective store text/data files on the server
Each user would get their own storage space to store files as well as access to public resources uploaded by other players. potentially file sharing could also be an option.
Files would be stored in either the config folder or the world folder. for each players private files they would be placed inside a folder named with the player UUID, for public files they would be placed inside a folder named public
This feature should be able to be disabled by server administrators using a config file as well, they should be able to set a limit for the amount of data each player can upload

A config file option to limit the max data size allowed for phones/computers/servers
