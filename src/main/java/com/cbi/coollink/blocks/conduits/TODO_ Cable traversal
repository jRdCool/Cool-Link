When a cable is passed through a conduit. the cable should be auto passed through the whole conduit in the direction
passed until meeting a junction box or the end of the cable. When a wall port is added that takes the cable out of the conduit
at which point the ones further down the line should be updated that the cable is no longer heading to them.
